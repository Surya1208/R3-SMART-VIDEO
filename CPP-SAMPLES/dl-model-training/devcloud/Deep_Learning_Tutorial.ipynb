    "## MNIST Database - Handwritten digits (0-9)'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On this tutorial we will use Python* to implement one Convolutional Neural Network - a simplified version of LeNet - that will recognized Handwritten digits. A project like this one, using the MNIST dataset is considered as the \"Hello World\" of Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Keras*, TensorFlow* and the MNIST database.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the description on their website, \"Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use TensorFlow as the backend for Keras. TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. MNIST database is also available as a Keras dataset, with 60k 28x28 images of the 10 digits along with a test set of 10k images, so it is very easy to import and use it on our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One good visual and interactive reference on what we are developing can be found here. The basic difference between our code and this interactive sample is the number and size of convolutional and fully-connected layers (LeNet uses two of each, we will use a single one, to reduce training time). We also adjusted the layers size to balance between accuracy and training time. We are achieving 98,54% of accuracy with less than 2 minutes training time on an Intel® Core™ processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code can also be optimized by several ways to increase accuracy, and we would like to invite you to explore this later, changing the number of epochs, filters, fully-connected neurons and also including additional convolutional and fully connected layers. You can also use flattening, dropout and batch normalization layers. Other optimization techniques can also be applied, so feel free to use this tutorial code as a base to explore those optimization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the convolutional and pooling layers are responsible for extracting a set of features from the input images, and the fully-connected layers are responsible for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers applies a set of filters to the input image to extract important features from the image. The filters are small matrixes also called image kernels that can be repeatedly applied to the input image (\"sliding\" the filter on the image). You may already used those filters on traditional image processing applications such as GIMP (i.e. blurring, sharpening or embossing). This article gives a good overview on image kernels with some live experiments. Each filter will generate a new image that will be the input for the next layer, typically a pooling layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling layers reduces the spatial size of the image (downsampling), reducing the computation in the network and also controlling overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully connected layers are traditional Neural Network layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing the Python* libraries and steps to be followed\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the exercise on devcloud, you need to do some preliminary steps to install the dependencies. Open a terminal and execute the following steps :-  \n",
    "\n",
    "- rm -rf ~/.local/\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you get permission denied error while executing the above step, change the permissions of the file and then delete it\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you get the message Device or Resource busy while executing  step a.), execute lsof +D /path which lists the open files       with their process id's..Then you can use kill -9 pid to kill that process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " After executing the above steps, you will get Kernel error. To solve this restart the kernel from the main page.\n",
    "\n",
    " After executing pip3 install keras tensorflow as shown in the next steps , again restart the kernel to avoid import errors.\n"
